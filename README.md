## Introduction
K-means, a clustering algorithm, is widely used in image processing for tasks like segmentation and compression. Its advantages include simplicity, efficiency, and adaptability to various image data types. The project explores K-means applications in image processing, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness.

## Project Description
The project employs K-means for image segmentation, quantization, compression, and color conversion. Image segmentation involves grouping pixels based on color similarity for object recognition. Image quantization reduces distinct colors for efficient storage and analysis. Image compression reduces file size without significant quality loss. Color conversion transforms colored images to grayscale while preserving essential details. The integrated pipeline demonstrates K-means capabilities and limitations, evaluated through metrics, user studies, and visual inspections.

## Architecture of Proposed System
The image processing system comprises the following modules:

1. Input Image Acquisition: The system begins by obtaining input images from diverse sources such as cameras, files, or databases.

2. Preprocessing: Acquired images undergo preprocessing, including noise removal, resizing, and normalization, to enhance their quality for subsequent processing.

3. Image Segmentation: This module divides the input image into meaningful segments based on characteristics like color, texture, or intensity.

4. Color Quantization: The system reduces the number of colors in an image while preserving visual appearance. This involves clustering similar colors using the K-means algorithm.

5. Image Compression: Utilizing the K-means algorithm, this module compresses image data by identifying representative colors through clustering, allowing for efficient storage and transmission.

6. Color to Grayscale Conversion: This module simplifies image representation by converting color images to grayscale, considering only intensity values.

7. Output Generation: The final step involves generating processed output, such as segmented, compressed, or grayscale images. Output can be visually displayed, saved, or used for further analysis.

## Results and Discussions 

### Metrics
#### Mean Squared Error (MSE):
Measures the average squared difference between the original and compressed/quantized image. Lower MSE indicates better similarity.

#### Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR):
Represents the ratio of the maximum possible power of the signal (image) to the power of the distortion (difference) caused by compression/quantization. Higher PSNR implies less distortion.

#### Structural Similarity Index (SSIM): 
Evaluates the similarity between the original and compressed/quantized image based on luminance, contrast, and structure. SSIM ranges from - 1 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect similarity.

#### Bitrate 
This refers to the rate at which data is transmitted or processed, often used in the context of digital media. It measures the amount of data that can be transmitted per unit of time, typically expressed in bits per second (bps).

#### Davies-Bouldin Index
It is a measure used to evaluate the quality of clustering results by considering both the intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster dissimilarity in a single value. 

####  Calinski-Harabasz Index 
It is a metric used to assess the quality of clustering by measuring the ratio of between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion.
